Yessss let’s GO 🔥

Here is your **complete full-stack pipeline**: how to create an API that sends emails using Python + FastAPI, run it in Docker on your **Windows laptop**, expose it to **ChatGPT** via **Cloudflare Tunnel**, and connect it via **Custom GPT actions**.

---

# 📦 FULL PROJECT: "Send Email" with GPT using FastAPI + Docker + Cloudflare Tunnel

---

## ✅ Final Result:

> You can say to your GPT:
> 
> 
> **"Send an email to [alice@example.com](mailto:alice@example.com) saying 'Hey Alice, the render is done!'"**
> 
> And GPT will call your local FastAPI server (in Docker) to send that email through your code.

## 📁 1. Project Structure

```
send-email-api/
├── Dockerfile
├── main.py
├── requirements.txt
└── cloudflare-setup.md  <-- notes for Cloudflare Tunnel setup

```

---

## 🔧 2. Install What You Need (once)

### ✅ Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.10+
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (enable WSL integration if on Windows)
- [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
- Install `cloudflared`:
Download from https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install/

Test it:

```bash
cloudflared --version

```

---

## 🐍 3. FastAPI App (main.py)

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
import smtplib
from email.message import EmailMessage

app = FastAPI()

class EmailRequest(BaseModel):
    to: str
    subject: str
    body: str

@app.post("/send-email")
def send_email(req: EmailRequest):
    email = EmailMessage()
    email["From"] = "your.email@gmail.com"
    email["To"] = req.to
    email["Subject"] = req.subject
    email.set_content(req.body)

    try:
        with smtplib.SMTP_SSL("smtp.gmail.com", 465) as smtp:
            smtp.login("your.email@gmail.com", "your-app-password")
            smtp.send_message(email)
        return {"status": "sent"}
    except Exception as e:
        return {"status": "error", "detail": str(e)}

```

> 🛡️ Use Gmail App Passwords instead of real password

## 📦 4. requirements.txt

```
fastapi
uvicorn[standard]

```

---

## 🐳 5. Dockerfile

```
FROM python:3.11

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]

```

---

## 🐳 6. Build & Run Docker Container

In your project folder:

```bash
docker build -t send-email-api .
docker run -p 8000:8000 send-email-api

```

Your app is now running locally in Docker at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/)

---

## 🌐 7. Expose with Cloudflare Tunnel

### Step-by-step

### a) Log into Cloudflare

```bash
cloudflared login

```

This will open a browser to link your account.

### b) Start tunnel:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8000

```

You’ll get a public HTTPS URL like:

```
https://your-tunnel-id.trycloudflare.com

```

Keep this running!

---

## 🤖 8. OpenAPI Spec (for Custom GPT Action)

Save as `openapi.yaml`:

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: Local Email API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: Send emails via a local FastAPI app exposed through Cloudflare
servers:
  - url: https://your-tunnel-id.trycloudflare.com
paths:
  /send-email:
    post:
      operationId: sendEmail
      summary: Sends an email to the specified address
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                to:
                  type: string
                subject:
                  type: string
                body:
                  type: string
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Result of email send
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  status:
                    type: string
                  detail:
                    type: string
                    nullable: true

```

> Replace your-tunnel-id.trycloudflare.com with the actual domain from your tunnel
>

## 🤖 9. Add to Custom GPT

1. Go to https://chat.openai.com/gpts/editor
2. In the **"Actions"** section:
    - Upload `openapi.yaml`
3. Save and test!

Try prompting:

> “Send an email to john@example.com with subject ‘Project Done’ and body ‘Hey John, everything’s finished. Cheers.’”
> 

---

## 🔐 10. Optional: Add Auth (Later)

If you're exposing this publicly and want to lock it down:

- Add an `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET` header in the OpenAPI spec
- Validate it in your FastAPI endpoint
- Or restrict by IP / domain in Cloudflare dashboard

---

## 🎉 That’s It — You’re Live!

You now have:

- ✅ A FastAPI app sending real emails
- ✅ Running in Docker on your Windows machine
- ✅ Exposed with a stable HTTPS URL
- ✅ Callable from ChatGPT as a Custom GPT Action

---

## 🛠️ Want Extras?

- 📂 `docker-compose.yml` to auto-start both API and Cloudflare
- 🔁 Auto-reloading API with `-reload`
- 🔐 Auth headers
- 📨 HTML emails
- ☁️ Deploy to Render or Fly later

Just say the word and I’ll help you layer it on.

Let me know if you want a GitHub-ready version of this project too!
